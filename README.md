# [pjz](https://github.com/spinsphotonics/fdtdz) ðŸ˜´ðŸ‘•ðŸ‘–ðŸ’¤ -- a small toolset for photonics on JAX

**pjz** (pee-jayz), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) augmented with [fdtd-z](https://github.com/spinsphotonics/fdtdz),
enables photonic designers to harness compute at scale
by providing a simple set of tools to express photonic simulation and optimization workflows in JAX.
